## background

While Duolingo allows its learners to understand the building blocks of the languages they learn, it can be difficult to understand and visualize how grammatical structures and interplay affect meaning and translation in larger pieces of foreign-langauge texts. Therefore, the aim of JavaSpanish is to provide an educational resource and visualization for select Spanish poems of how grammatical structures, parts of speech, phrasing, and the nuance of English translation play into these works.

## functionality & mvps

In JavaSpanish, users will be able to:

- Choose from a selection of Spanish-language poetry
- On the poem itself, hover with their cursor over lines to see their English translation
- Select from a collection of parts of speech and grammatical concepts to highlight in the chosen poem all instances of the selected concept

## technologies, libraries, apis

Poems and their translations will be sourced from either books or reputable websites, the library will be populated with ChatGPT and my personal oversite, and I will supplement grammatical data.
