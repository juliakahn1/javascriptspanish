# JavaSpanish

## background

While Duolingo allows its learners to understand the building blocks of the languages they learn, it can be difficult to understand and visualize how grammatical structures and interplay affect meaning and translation in larger pieces of foreign-langauge texts. Therefore, the aim of JavaSpanish is to provide an educational resource and visualization for select Spanish poems of how grammatical structures, parts of speech, phrasing, and the nuance of English translation play into these works.

## functionality & mvps

In JavaSpanish, users will be able to:

Choose from a selection of Spanish poetry by select Spanish-speaking poets
Select poetry ranging from a grammatical and translation level and complexity of easy to difficult
On the poem itself, hover with their cursor over words to identify their grammatical data/part of speech
On the poem itself, hover with their cursor over words and/or phrases to access English translations
Select from a collection of parts of speech and grammatical concepts to highlight in the chosen poem all instances of the selected concept

## wireframes

## technologies, libraries, apis

In this stage of development, the APIs and/or libraries utilized for this project aren’t set — supporting APIs specializing in formatting and text transformation would be ideal. Poems and their translations will be sourced from either books or reputable websites, and I will supplement grammatical data.


# implementation timeline

This timeline is tentative and is subject to change. More details to come.

### Friday afternoon and weekend

- Selecting initial poems to include in the project and some north star poems (starting with one poem).
- Determining how to organize a JSON database (containing poem, grammar, and Spanish-English translation phrasing key-values) to best access this data for rendering on a page and organization into classes.
- Create a JSON data file in the project.
- Begin HTML and CSS skeleton.
- Begin formatting CSS for event triggers (hovers, button states, highlighted text)
- Research CSS treatments.
- Begin database-class functionality.

### Monday

- Begin events logic and handlers.
- Finish database-class functionality .
- Begin CSS treatment of event triggers .
